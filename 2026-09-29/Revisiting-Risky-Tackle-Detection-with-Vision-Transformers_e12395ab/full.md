Abstract. This paper is a Track 2 reproducibility companion to an ICPR 2026 study on risky tackle detection in American football practice videos [8]. The original work fine-tuned a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) on 733 clips labeled with the SATT-3 rubric. It used focal loss, Taguchi L<sub>18</sub> augmentation, and 5-fold cross-validation. It reported riskyclass recall of 0.67 and risky-class F1 of 0.59. This companion documents the released artifact and traces those numbers to specific scripts, fold outputs, and aggregation files. The reproduced headline is run\_15. It combines Gaussian noise with static brightness decrease and uses no rotation and no flip. Its fold-mean risky recall is 0.667 and its fold-mean risky F1 is 0.588. These values match the published headline after rounding. The ablation shows that brightness is the dominant factor. Its risky-recall main-efect range is 0.055, which is larger than the ranges for rotation, flip, and noise. Without augmentation, ViViT reaches risky recall of 0.545 and does not exceed the C3D baseline of 0.583. The raw clips show identifiable student athletes, so they cannot be redistributed. The artifact provides a public sample for pipeline checks and a controlled route for full-data review.

## 1 Introduction

Head and neck injuries in American football are strongly linked to poor tackling form. Practice is where form is taught and corrected. Coaches cannot review every repetition on film. Risky repetitions can therefore go unnoticed. Automated detection can rank clips for coach review and help standardize feedback across sessions. Nafi et al. established the task with a 3D convolutional network on practice clips [4]. Follow-up work isolated the relevant athletes through instance segmentation [5]. The broader goal is a safety pipeline that works under tight data and compute constraints.

This companion uses a design-of-experiments view. Taguchi orthogonal arrays provide a compact way to study augmentation factors under a fixed compute budget [7]. The tackle task needs this kind of controlled ablation because the full factorial augmentation space is large and video training is expensive.

Four constraints make the task hard. The labels are imbalanced, with 64.7% safe and 35.3% risky clips. The discriminative signal often appears near first contact. Training is compute intensive. The footage shows identifiable student athletes and is governed by an institutional review protocol.

The original study [8] uses 733 single-athlete tackle clips recorded against a padded dummy. The set contains 474 safe clips and 259 risky clips. Each clip is trimmed to 32 frames, with 15 frames before and 16 frames after the first point of contact (FPOC). FPOC localization is manual in [8]. A zero-shot alternative, GRAZE, was later developed on the same dataset [9]. Labels follow the SATT-3 rubric. Scores of 0 or 1 map to risky. Scores of 2 or 3 map to safe. The model is ViViT [1], initialized from google/vivit-b-16x2-kinetics400 pretrained on Kinetics-400 [2]. Inputs are 32 frames at 224 × 224. Training uses focal loss [3] [6], balanced sampling, 5-fold stratified cross-validation, and a Taguchi $L _ { 1 8 }$ augmentation schedule. The headline is risky recall 0.67 and risky F1 0.59. The C3D baseline reaches risky recall 0.583 and risky F1 0.560 [4]. The model in this artifact is specifically ViViT. It is not a per-frame image ViT.

This companion makes five contributions. First, it provides a documented pipeline that can be tested on a public sample. Authorized users can run it on the full dataset after local path configuration. Second, it maps the main reported numbers to scripts, configurations, and output files. Third, it explains the data-access restriction for the IRB-constrained clips. Fourth, it states that the heatmap values are the fold-mean opt\_\* metrics selected with per-fold macro-F1 threshold tuning. Fifth, it reports a Taguchi $L _ { 1 8 }$ main-efects analysis and shows that brightness decrease is the strongest augmentation factor.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the artifact and environment. Section 3 describes data access. Section 4 traces the headline result. Section 5 reports the reproducibility analysis. Section 6 gives lessons learned. Section 7 concludes.

## 2 Artifact Overview and Environment

## 2.1 Repository and Script Inventory

The anonymous artifact is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/ r/tacklestudy\_vivit-7919/readme.md. The repository contains the released code, public-sample utilities, and environment files. Table 1 maps each result to its code lineage and output artifact.

The headline lineage uses vivit\_train\_taguchi.py. The script sets 32 frames, input size 224, batch size 2, 50 maximum epochs, google/vivit-b-16x2-kinetics400, and gradient accumulation over 8 steps. It uses a WeightedRandomSampler, early stopping, and macro-F1 threshold tuning. The released script exposes focal-loss hyperparameters through command-line arguments. Its parser defaults are $\alpha = 0 . 6$ and $\gamma = 1 . 6$ , but the archived SLURM logs for the reported heatmap record $\alpha = 0 . 5 5$ and $\gamma = 1 . 3$ We therefore treat $\alpha = 0 . 5 5$ and γ = 1.3 as the reproduction settings for Table 3 and Table 6. The same script writes both standard argmax metrics (std\_\*) and threshold-tuned metrics (opt\_\*) into metrics\_summary.csv. The reported heatmap uses the opt\_\* columns.

Table 1. Paper-to-code mapping for the released artifact.
<table><tr><td>Paper item</td><td>Script or source</td><td>Config.</td><td>Output artifact</td></tr><tr><td>Headline and Table 3</td><td>vivit_train_taguchi.py plus</td><td>50 epochs</td><td>metrics_summary.csv; con- solidated heatmap</td></tr><tr><td> $L _ { 1 8 }$  main effects in Table 5</td><td>consolidate_metrics.py heatmap values from opt_* metrics</td><td>5 folds</td><td>performance heatmap</td></tr><tr><td>Complete heatmap audit in Table 6</td><td>consolidate_metrics.py</td><td>fold means</td><td>consolidated_metrics.csv</td></tr><tr><td>Public-sample build</td><td>Taguchi_datasets.py</td><td>demo split</td><td>taguchi_runs/run_*/</td></tr><tr><td>Full-data fold directories</td><td>prepared taguchi_runs</td><td>5-fold L18</td><td>run_*/fold_*/</td></tr><tr><td>Full-sweep job submission</td><td>SLURM launcher</td><td>20 runs, 5 folds</td><td>job logs</td></tr><tr><td>Statistical aggregation</td><td>consolidate_taguchi.py</td><td>optional</td><td>summary CSV files and figures</td></tr></table>

consolidate\_metrics.py crawls the result tree, reads each metrics\_summary.csv, and writes a consolidated metric table. Its plotting routine uses the opt\_risky\_recall, opt\_accuracy, and opt\_macro\_f1 columns. This confirms that the heatmap lineage is threshold-tuned, not an argmax-only lineage. Taguchi\_datasets.py constructs the public-sample run directories. It implements static brightness increase and static brightness decrease. The full 733-clip results are tied to the archived full-data fold directories and archived metric outputs.

The released scripts keep local path variables for run directories. Reproducers must update those paths for their own storage. This keeps the artifact close to the code used in the study while allowing review on a diferent machine.

## 2.2 Software Environment

The environment is pinned in Environment.yml. It uses Python 3.10 with the CUDA 12.1 build of PyTorch 2.2.2. It also includes torchvision 0.17.2, transformers 4.51.3, timm 0.4.12, decord 0.6.0, opencv-python 4.10, numpy 1.23.5, and scikit-learn 1.4.2. Reporting uses pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. Setup uses Listing 1.1.

Listing 1.1. Environment setup.
<table><tr><td>conda env create -f Environment.yml conda activate vivit_pyt</td></tr></table>

Four dependency risks matter. The ViViT checkpoint should be cached if the training system has limited internet access. The pinned transformers version was validated with timm 0.4.12. Upgrading timm may change the model loading path. Decord 0.6.0 may also require a source build on some Linux systems. Writing taguchi\_summary.xlsx needs the openpyxl engine for pandas. It is not currently pinned in Environment.yml, so a fresh install may need it added manually.

## 2.3 Hardware and Compute Budget

The reported full-data runs used one NVIDIA H100-80GB GPU per job on PSC Bridges-2 through an ACCESS allocation. The full sweep contains 20 runs and 5 folds per run, for 100 model trainings. The job launcher processes three runs per job and loops over folds 0 through 4. The full sweep was run in batches. The cost was about 72 GPU-hours, or about 3 to 4 hours per run. Gradient accumulation over 8 steps gives an efective batch size of 16.

Storage is separate from compute. Each run keeps its own augmented train and validation clips for every fold. The full Taguchi build occupies about 700 GB. A reproducer with limited storage should process runs in batches and archive metrics before deleting completed run directories.

The public-sample workflow is lighter. A single modern CUDA GPU can test preprocessing, training, evaluation, and aggregation. Lower-memory GPUs need a smaller batch size. Reducing the frame count below 32 is expected to reduce risky recall, but that efect was not measured here.

## 3 Data Access and IRB Considerations

The 733 clips show identifiable student athletes during practice. The institutional review protocol does not permit public redistribution of the raw clips. This restriction also covers the 178-clip subset first used in [4].

The class distribution afects every metric. There are 474 safe clips (64.7%) and 259 risky clips (35.3%). This is a 1.83 to 1 ratio. A classifier that predicts safe for every clip reaches 64.7% accuracy but misses every risky tackle. This failure mode motivates a recall-first evaluation.

A public sample is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ ahsanzaidi786 / tacklenet-sample. It supports environment setup, rundirectory construction, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and metric aggregation. It does not support quantitative reproduction of the reported crossvalidation metrics. Full reproduction of Table 6 requires the full 733-clip dataset.

Reviewers who need restricted clips for badge evaluation can request access during review. Requests are routed through the RRPR chairs and then to the authors. Each requester signs a data use agreement. The agreement restricts use to the evaluation of this submission. It also prohibits redistribution and re-identification. It requires deletion of the clips after review closes. After the agreement is countersigned, the data are delivered through a university-managed secure transfer service. Access is limited to the named requester.

## 4 Reproducing the Headline Results

Twenty configurations were evaluated. Eighteen use the Taguchi $L _ { 1 8 }$ augmentation schedule. run\_0 uses oversampling without transformation. run\_0\_original uses neither oversampling nor augmentation. Each configuration is evaluated with 5 stratified folds. The headline result corresponds to run\_15. That run combines Gaussian noise with static brightness decrease and uses no rotation and no flip. It reaches risky recall 0.667 and risky F1 0.588.

Listing 1.2 gives the verification workflow. The full-data step requires the authorized 733-clip fold directories.

Listing 1.2. Verification workflow for the released code.  
```shell
# Step 1: create the environment
conda env create -f Environment.yml
conda activate vivit_pyt
# Step 2a: verify the public-sample pipeline
python Taguchi_datasets.py \
--video_root /path/to/public_sample/videos \
--label_csv /path/to/public_sample/labels.csv \
--output_root taguchi_runs
# Step 2b: run one authorized full-data fold
python vivit_train_taguchi.py \
--runs run_15 \
--fold 0 \
--alpha 0.55 \
--gamma 1.3 \
--threshold_strategy macro_f1
# Step 2c: run the complete full-data sweep on the cluster
# For the archived heatmap, use the log-recorded focal-loss values.
bash run_vivit_train_taguchi.sh h100-80:1 GPU-shared asc180003p
# Step 3: aggregate the metric files
python consolidate_metrics.py
python consolidate_taguchi.py --results_dir ./taguchi_runs_GRADCAM_RESULTS
```

The script reports two metric families. The std\_\* values use the standard 0.5 threshold through argmax. The opt\_\* values use a per-fold threshold selected to maximize macro-F1 on that fold. The published heatmap and the reproduced headline use the opt\_\* values. This distinction is necessary for exact reproduction.

The current script parser defaults are α = 0.6 and $\gamma = 1 . 6$ . Those defaults are useful for rerunning the public artifact. They are not used as the source of the published heatmap in this companion. The heatmap audit uses the SLURM-log configuration, α = 0.55 and γ = 1.3.

The main-paper abstract reports risky recall and risky F1. Fig. 4 in [8] reports all five heatmap metrics for run\_15. The row above therefore repeats the full heatmap values for that configuration.

ViViT without augmentation reaches risky recall 0.545 in the archived heatmap. This rounds to 0.55, not 0.58. The original ICPR narrative text states this baseline as 0.58, which is close to the C3D value of 0.583. This companion uses the heatmap value, 0.545, since the heatmap is the direct source for these tables. Readers checking the original text should expect this small diference. The best Taguchi configuration exceeds C3D by 0.084 in risky recall and by 0.028 in risky F1. This comparison is descriptive. The C3D baseline and the ViViT experiment were not run under the same controlled protocol.

## 5 Reproducibility Analysis

## 5.1 Lineage and Aggregation

The reported heatmap values are the threshold-tuned opt\_\* values. Each fold writes both standard and optimal metrics to metrics\_summary.csv. consolidate\_metrics.py gathers those files and creates consolidated summaries. This is why Table 3 and Table 6 use threshold-tuned fold means.

The practical path requirement is simple. BASE\_RUNS\_DIR must point to a directory with the expected run\_ $\boldsymbol { * } / \mathbf { f } \circ \mathrm { 1 d _ { - } } \boldsymbol { * }$ structure. RESULTS\_BASE\_DIR must point to the output tree that stores the per-fold metrics\_summary.csv files. Reviewers can check the public-sample pipeline without the restricted clips.

## 5.2 Taguchi $\pmb { L _ { 1 8 } }$ Factors

The ablation varies four augmentation factors. Noise has 2 levels. Brightness, rotation, and flip have 3 levels each. This gives a full factorial space of 54 combinations. The Taguchi $L _ { 1 8 }$ array covers the same factor set with 18 runs. This reduces the cost from about 160 to 220 GPU-hours to about 54 to 72 GPU-hours. The design estimates main efects under an orthogonality assumption. It does not estimate factor interactions.

Brightness has the largest range. Decreased brightness is the best level. A plausible explanation is that reduced luminance suppresses background clutter and makes the contact region more salient. Rotation is second. No rotation is the best rotation level. Large geometric changes can disturb orientation cues that matter for tackle form. Noise and flip have smaller efects. The best observed run combines noise with brightness decrease and uses no rotation and no flip.

## 5.3 Stability of Comparisons

Across the 18 $L _ { 1 8 }$ runs, risky recall spans 0.498 to 0.667. The standard deviation is 0.041. Risky F1 spans 0.497 to 0.588. Its standard deviation is 0.020. F1 is more stable than recall. Augmentation mainly changes the recall and precision tradeof. Those shifts partly cancel in F1.

The comparison against C3D should be read with care. run\_15 exceeds the C3D baseline by 0.084 recall and 0.028 F1. The comparison is not fully controlled. The two systems were trained on diferent dataset sizes and under diferent protocols. This companion documents the conditions under which the reported result was obtained. It does not claim a definitive superiority margin.

Folds are assigned at the clip level using stratified splitting. The same athlete can appear in both training and validation folds. This can make performance estimates optimistic. Athlete-stratified or session-stratified splits are the recommended next step.

## 5.4 Experimental Protocol and Generalization

Each clip is trimmed to a 32-frame window. The window contains 15 frames before the annotated FPOC and 16 frames after it. Raw clips run 200 to 1500 frames at 30 fps before trimming. Frames are resized to 224×224. BGR frames are converted to RGB before the ViViT processor. FPOC localization is described in [8] and automated in [9].

The label schema follows the SATT-3 rubric. Scores 0 and 1 map to risky, label 1. Scores 2 and 3 map to safe, label 0. Domain experts annotated all 733 clips. The final distribution is 474 safe clips and 259 risky clips.

Augmentation is applied only to training splits after fold construction. Validation folds contain original clips only. The risky class is targeted so that training approaches class balance. A subset of safe clips is also augmented. This reduces the chance that the model separates classes by augmentation artifacts alone. The quantitative results are tied to the archived full-data fold directories and the archived metric outputs.

The generalization scope is narrow. The dataset comes from one institution with fixed recording conditions. Performance may degrade under diferent camera angles, standof distances, helmet styles, pad styles, field surfaces, and athlete body types. Clip-level folds may also inflate recall relative to athlete-stratified or session-stratified evaluation.

## 6 Lessons Learned

The readme, license, and environment file were reconstructed during artifact preparation. Rebuilding an environment from a live codebase is slow and error prone. Recording dependency versions at project start is much cheaper.

Metric lineage must be explicit. The heatmap values are threshold-tuned opt\_\* metrics. A reproducer who uses standard argmax metrics will not obtain the same table. The artifact therefore writes both metric families and names them in the output CSV files.

A shared configuration file would make future audits easier. The main settings should be captured in one machine-readable file. Scripts should load that file and apply explicit command-line overrides. This would reduce ambiguity about focal-loss weights, sampler behavior, and threshold selection. The focalloss discrepancy between script defaults and SLURM logs is the clearest example.

Reviewer data access needs early planning. A data use agreement and a secure transfer route take time to set up. Teams working with identifiable participant footage should plan this route during data collection, not after acceptance.

The $L _ { 1 8 }$ design covered a 54-combination factor space with only 18 model trainings. It saved about 108 to 144 GPU-hours compared with an exhaustive search. The main-efects analysis still isolated a clear factor: brightness decrease.

## 7 Conclusion

The headline result of [8] is reproduced from the released artifact lineage. run\_15 reaches risky recall 0.667 and risky F1 0.588. These values match the reported 0.67 and 0.59 after rounding. The artifact documents the training script, the threshold-tuned metric files, and the aggregation path behind the heatmap.

Brightness decrease is the strongest augmentation factor. ViViT without augmentation does not exceed the C3D baseline in risky recall. Clip-level fold construction is the main protocol limitation. Athlete-stratified or session-stratified evaluation is the recommended next step.
